Insert : 
    Into leaf node: 
        1. space is available to insert a vector in leaf node.
        // inserts data 
        // updates the N, LS, SS of LeafNode .. 
            
            
            this returns a delta pointer.. how much of this nodes content has been changed.

            // update the parentPtr(CFNODE) of the leafNode data :: Returns a delta pointer change in the N, LS, SS
            // iterate over the stack path -- for getting the parent node (internal node always)
            // update all the nodes CFNODE pointer & Internal Node poitner (stack path) with this delta pointer
        // Done

    Into internal node:
        1. space is available to insert a CFNODe into internal Node:

        this returns a delta pointer.. how much of this nodes content has been changed
        
        take this delta pointer
