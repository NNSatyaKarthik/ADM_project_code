t5_2qi63,There are free concerts and fireworks every night for the Para PanAm games. Google 'panamania' and you'll find the schedule.  Also check out the side bar ('Amazing activities in Toronto'), and the website BlogTO for events. BlogTO is also great for food suggestions since they do a lot of top 10 lists for different types of restaurants around the city.  Toronto being a popular tourist destination this question gets asked pretty much everyday so what's put in the sidebar is actually good stuff. For more responses maybe do a little research and then come back to ask if you're having trouble deciding between specific events/restaurants/whatever and people are usually happy to chime in with their opinions. It's just a little hard to recommend stuff when we don't know anything about you. :)  Enjoy the visit!
t5_2sqho,Logically it would be in America because it would make it easier to qualify for events as they would likely stay the #1 team in NA however if they were striving to improve they would move to Europe
t5_2qh2p,It's an evangelical religion, they're both taught it, and inspired to spread their faith. The problem is, Islam is also Evangelical. So, when they discussed their Religions, they didn't hear stories of compassion and friendship, they heard "You are wrong."
t5_2t403,[](/sovietsparkle)Now what you need is a gymnasterka. Or two.
t5_2qh0u,You'll pass several of the good ones if you drive from Aberdeen thru Inverness up toward Dornoch
t5_2qlqh,&gt; I have to go click the back nav button.  Forgive me, but why is that a bad thing? Isn't that what the back button is for? And once you got that, why two ways to do the same thing?

t5_2qqjc,Ridiculous.  You'd never find Gretzky in the corner.  That's why he had McSorely.
t5_31hwk,that would work, message me on steam. I'm Sketch_is_Random
t5_2ug10,;D
t5_2rpe6,I played against an exodia deck that won on the first turn once. Can't imagine what's satisfying about that.

t5_2qh1i,How many times I've attempted suicide. How often I crave death. 
t5_2t9x3,Why doesn't Irelia need hydra, her low cd ult?
t5_2tonr,Yeah, I'm not noticing the ones in a dress or a skirt.
t5_2qqdb,The comments ...   I feel sick.
t5_2qh9i,Na moral, dizer que a Globo apoiou o Lula em 89 s√≥ pode ser trolling
t5_2s580,The thing is, they shouldn't be directly invited if that incident took a place. Hell, UG is banned. Granted, they did that shit multiple times, but being extra careful and keeping an eye on EG when they play anything wouldn't hurt, you have no idea whether they did something like that after this incident, but this time logged on a different account or not logged in at all.  CS:GO C9 was too liked and respected by fans all around the world. Then the drug incident happened.
t5_2qpp6,Agreed, I'm running a GTX 760 from Msi and can run this game at 1920x1080, 60+fps, at full extreme settings, card cost roughly $400 at the time, but it's probably much cheaper now.
t5_2tx47,Wine and more wine :) 
t5_2rfxx,Yes that happens many times why? Because the game is not decided by one players performance, wins are decided by teamfights/objective control
t5_2qqjc,Good to know. :-)  It's in one of the older ones - a quick look at the Discworld wiki says Men at Arms.

t5_2qlqp,The price he would get depends entirely on where he sells them. In an upmarket store he might get several multiples of the quoted price; in a regular store they might not sell at all.
t5_2sgoq,My day will come. Nice pickup
t5_2wbww,They can, can't they?  Isn't this a Menagerie or Games room thing?
t5_2r05i,Wait wait wait, you thought that people saw things through their eyebrows? Dude...
t5_2qh1i,Most mayo in Norway comes in aluminium/some other metal, whilst toothpaste usually comes in plastic, so it'd be hard to mistake the two. 
t5_2sxpk,Rebirth's controller support is one of my favorite things about this game.    Twin stick shooter games like this beg for a controller.    I'm playing mostly on 3DS now because it runs full speed on there and that's pretty cool, too.
t5_2qhj4,To be fair Igor has like rocket propelled fists.
t5_2qi58,It was just a joke. I was referencing [this](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/competitions/premier-league/10615728/Manchester-City-v-Chelsea-Jose-Mourinho-hands-team-talk-to-masseur.html)

t5_2qhjz,Well, it's depend where you live... If you work and live in Paris, you don't need a driver's license for example.
t5_2qiye,I'd like to point out that if you're an average sized, reasonably strong man, this is overkill for a Macgregor.  Macgregor masts are pretty light weight, I raise mine by hand with no mechanical assistance.  The link says you have to step up onto the cabin during the raise, but that's not really true, I just stand on the cabin top and pick up the mast.  I'd say the most I have to lift is about 80 pounds to get it started.  If I'm alone I just keep a line tied to the mainsheet or jib sheet to keep tension forward on the mast once it's up until I can secure the forestay.  I think the Catalina masts are heavier built, so I can't recommend this to OP without knowing how heavy it is.
t5_2qrtt,I swear to God the wardrobe of every imgur commenter consists or ONLY cargo pants and graphic starwars tees
t5_2qnp7,I did plan, but my planning was a little off. And I had Scotch, does that count?
t5_2qh1i,[deleted]
t5_2rxrw,Not really. I experience sex as really important, and it's crucial that it works well for all involved in a long-term relationship, exclusive or not. I guess it would be an issue if I felt like sex was the only thing we really had in common, but a person I felt that way about would probably be a fuck buddy at most, not a romantic partner.
t5_2rnve,Yep. I was on mobile and didn't take the time to actually look. My bad 
t5_2qh53,Who would attack us nowadays? France? Poland? It just seems silly for a German to be afraid of an attack when we're surrounded by friends. I do think however a German army could do good things like peace keeping missions in Africa. 
t5_2qhg1,I'll also give the nod to Ayinger for overall flavor, but the SN Oktoberfest crushes it in the "quality to price" metric. At $8-9 for a six pack (vs $3.50 for a pint bottle), I'll be drinking a hell of a lot of the SN version this fall. 
t5_2s6oc,I would recommend [Yukichigai Unofficial Patch](http://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/51664/?) over Mission Mojave. It's a pure bugfix patch and will be more compatible with other mods.
t5_2qh1i,Yeah they never delete accounts and the pets never die either
t5_2upjd,Lol 2 stems in 45 minutes isn't smoking slowly.
t5_2qs08,Chase has has one of the fastest cars all day.  Rallied all the way to p5 after starting at the tail end, but now has an issue with the RF brake.  Hes saying that he might not even have a RF brake right now, but is still managing to be one of the fastest cars on track 
t5_2qhwp,**Team Fortress 2** is solid. Like, really solid. It's just so much fun, yet so simple. I kind of wish I had a go to server, and was a bit better at playing spy or sniper, but other than that - it's just a great game to play a few rounds of and just leave.  Also, reinstalled and have been playing the starter edition of **World of Warcraft** again, I've got all the classes to level 20, so I'm at that level cap, thinking of re-subbing, but I've just been having a little fun doing some LFG dungeons, and going on hunts for new pets on my hunters in Alliance zones. Was fun sneaking round the guards in the dwarven zones to get a polar bear.
t5_2uc6j,A "Drama" flair servers a purpose, but I don't think it needs to be automatically linked to "Forum" flair. I'm sure I was part of the discussion when adding it, but I am easily confused.
t5_2qh33,But would they hang out with you?

t5_2rct2,Actually, I've been noticing a less and less of this with the men I meet off OkC. A few years ago, it seemed like every guy I met looked marginally (or even substantially) better than his profile pics. Lately, however, I've experienced the opposite. More and more frequently, my dates are slightly less attractive than I was expecting (and I've also noticed that many guys' mains are much more attractive than the rest of their own pics). My theory is that men (or at least the ones in my dating pool) are getting more savvy about selfies/what constitutes an attractive picture.
t5_2qhl2,It is different than 45 years ago but double the price adjusting for inflation, double? I can understand a few thousand but double is insane
t5_2rd6n,Fair enough. I guess i didnt read into it that well.
t5_2qh1i,What a monster, right?
t5_2qh9w,Try the meatball. Fixes that problem, really good.
t5_2tbbg,Skin type: Oily  AM routine :  Cereve foaming cleaser  pat dry  Aveeno daily moisturizing lotion  Coppertone Sport sunscreen  PM routine :  Cereve foaming cleaser   pat dry  Neostrata 10% Glycolic acid  wait 30 minutes   Aveeno lotion  Fairly new to skincare routines.. Am I doing it right? I also just ordered Paulas Choice 2% liquid, where would I fit this in my routine? Thank you!!  
t5_2qhx4,Had the exact same thing happen at my gym. This girl was skin and bones. She was always there when I came in for my lunch hour session and she would be there when I left, furiously pedaling away with a puddle of sweat on the floor beneath. Told management and they told me they were going to have someone talk to her that day. Haven't seen her in a while but wonder sometime what happened to her after.
t5_2r40o,i dont see a sequel anywhere 
t5_2r2jt,While trump is far from being a decent human being, I think his comments are legitimately being taken way out of context in a lot of instances, as in they are always specific to certain situations where he'll just be hitting back or capitalizing on an opportunity to make a joke. The other aspect is that he partially speaks that way because he knows the media will jump on it, and his tactic is "any press is good press," he knows that if the media is talking about him and the shit he said they aren't talking about the other candidates. Trump isn't stupid, that motherfucker understands exactly what he's doing, and he's damn good at it. I also don't see how everyone thinks he's so much worse than other candidates, you have shit heads like Huckabee who said he wants to assign the 5th and 14th amendment rights to embryos, and their ideas of social reform are horrendous. Donald may be a piece of shit, but at least we know exactly what we'll get, he owns up to it and I'd rather have him in office than most of the other candidates on the GOP side, whom are actually still way less reasonable than Donald Trump, it's not obvious if all you see are sound bites of Donald Trump, but it's obvious after watching full speeches where he actually does clarify his positions somewhat. Either way, we should all want him to be the nominee, because it will ultimately guarantee another democrat in office.

t5_2r7yd,Yeah that sounds hairier than I want to get into. I didn't realize the Bourne shell was the inspiration for the IOCCC! That's terrifying.
t5_2v94d,You have to pay $35. That's it, and has always been it. Everything above that is funding the development. 
t5_2qh33,The test cock snapped off the backflow. Call Ewing irrigation for a new one.

t5_2re7h,Selling players adds funds to the current year you are in. They made nearly 20m euros from their sales, and they have a fraction of our budget bill and they still made very few purchases other then Gomez.   Running for club president is the same thing as running for political office. Every candidate ever has said that they are going to buy Messi and Ronaldo and Pele to get elected. Nothing new. 
t5_2t2oy,LoL? Play some CS:GO and I'll give you a link ;)
t5_2qhx4,The whole ass to grass squat is all around complete bullshit.  There are many ways to squat because there are many different mobility issues.    If you are butt winking I am going to bring out a box at the height of where you don't wink.  Once you learn the motor control and we clear up your joint issue ie your femor is not running into your pelvis then we can start going down further.    Until then we want to avoid getting spondy and other crazy low back issues.  
t5_323oy,I feel like in a movie with a lot of explosions and action, your mind is drawn away from what the characters are saying, so having the subtitles on draws your mind back to paying attention to the dialogue  
t5_2qh1e,I was thinking exactly that. They don't have to deal with her and issues. Just call the police and tell her to leave the premises and refuse to service her.   But they probably receive no training to deal with that level of escalation from customers. 
t5_2qhj4,Shogun was ruthless. RIP Pride
t5_2s580,in terms of stamina yes. the two EG-LGD games must have been so exhausting.

t5_2qh1i,My bar tool! I can open cans and bottles. I can get the pour spout that's stuck in the liquor bottle out! I can use it like an ice pick! Swing it on my finger when I'm bored and I'm pretty sure if I tried hard enough it could be a weapon.
t5_2qh68,yep, about the same.
